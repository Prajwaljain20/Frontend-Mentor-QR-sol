### What I learned

Got to know about this website and the challenges it has. I was searching for something like this to pratice upon and boost frontend skills.
Every challenge brings something new with it. In frontend there is no define path to make a certain design. It totaly depends on exploration and time spending with the code that shapes the interface.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
